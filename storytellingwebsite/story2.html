    <p>In the kingdom of Eldoria, a fearsome dragon named Pyroth guarded a mountain of gold. Legend said he was cursed by an ancient sorcerer, doomed to protect treasures he could never enjoy.</p>
    <p>A brave knight, Sir Galen, set out to slay the beast and claim the gold for his people. Armed with sword and shield, he climbed the treacherous peaks, facing storms and wild beasts.</p>
    <p>Upon reaching the dragon's lair, Galen found Pyroth not raging, but weeping. The curse had stolen his ability to fly and breathe fire freely. Moved by pity, Galen sought the sorcerer's descendant to break the spell.</p>
    <p>Through trials and tribulations, Galen learned that the curse was born of greed. By sharing the gold with the needy, the curse lifted. Pyroth regained his freedom, and Galen became a hero of wisdom, not war.</p>
    <p>The kingdom prospered, and the dragon became its protector, a symbol that true strength lies in compassion.</p>
